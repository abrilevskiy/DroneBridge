**Feature requests that only target a small user group will be ignored. Every UAV project is different. The developers are not your personal programmers. DroneBridge can easily be personalized using plugins. Those are powerful, can be used with every future release and are easy to develop. Please read more about it in the Wiki.**

e.g. Custom actions that can be triggered via a RC hardware switch are highly individual. Please consider a plugin or a new kind of communication message. The Android app is considered to be the main user interface.

Support for new hardware depends on its benefits and availability.
